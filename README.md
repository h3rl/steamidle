## Features

* Autorestart - idling will stop automaticaly if you start playing a game urselves. And when you are done and exit your game, idling will continue.

## Setup Guide

It's megasimple
1. Download repo and unzip
2. edit config.json and fill username, password. If you want to idle more games just add the game id of your game to the list (config.json). Game ids can be found [here](https://steamdb.info/).
3. doubleclick run.bat and you will get guided trough how to install required software, unless already installed.

If you are on linux use run.sh instead.

note: Setup installs node, and runs 'npm install' for getting needed dependencies.

## Note

if you bought this you got scammed lol
